XAMLGameFunctions
=================

This library was made as a hobby project. It is meant to give supporting functions to native XAML game development not be a full fledged game engine of any kind by itself. While it's currently very small I hope to expand on it bit by bit.

A simple demo of the LocationMarker class can be found here: https://github.com/No-ops/LocationMarkerDemo
